# BelleMaison

Real estate website created for the project in Java Web Programming Diploma for Montreal College.

## TODO List:
### index.html
- ~~Change Explore section to include icon to link to property page.~~
- ~~Alter some styling for Why Us? section~~
- ~~Automatically changing div on Testimonial section.~~
- Create form for Contact Us section containing form and JS to send data over.
- Create footer contains misc pages (maynot need to implement them all)
- Include digital clock on the top right corner on the header section.

### Start working on following pages:
- condo.html + house.html + vacant-land.html or properties.html (depending if JS can handle context switching easily)
- login.html (Nice to have just for pseudo mockup, if added need to modify index.html to show the info)

### Features on properties pages
- List up to xx row
- Each row display following:
  - Thumbnail image
  - Price
  - Size
  - Date posted
  - Location
  - Type
  - ID
  - Company posted
- Click on the row will bring up new div on top of others showing all details relating to the location.
- At the bottom of the detail page, show the loan calculator automatically fill data from the clicked row.
- Also contain the information in order to 1-click and send all required info to the company, similar to the contact us in the home page but also include the loan information user input.

### Nice to have goodies:
#### index.html
- JS: Testimonial slide show, automatically changes every 10 seconds, and can force change it as well.
- JS: Parallax header, menu should start at the center then scroll up to the top when reached 100vh.
- JS: Parallax background on all background-image bgimg-x section.
- JS: Switch from buttons on header to dropdown menu under certain size
- JS: Replace digital clock with analog clock behind the welcome message.
